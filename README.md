# Diabetes_Prediction_Model

**Overview**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health-related attributes of patients and aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The project is implemented in Python using popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes dataset, which contains information about various health metrics of patients, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more. The dataset can be found on Kaggle.

**Project Structure**

**'Diabetes_Prediction_Model.py'**: Python script containing the data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.

**README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

**Installation**
To run the script, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

**pandas, 
numpy, 
matplotlib, 
seaborn, 
scikit-learn**

**You can install the required libraries using pip**:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

**Usage**

1.**Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure that the dataset file (e.g., diabetes.csv) is in the same directory as the script.

2.**Run the Script**: Execute the following command to preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.
